    <a><h1><h1>WHO WE ARE</h1></a>
    <ul>
    	<li>
    	<h2>
		Old Town was formed in February 2017 by Tom McGeveran, Josh Benson and Katherine Lehr.
		</h2>
		</li>
      	<li>
      	<h2>
		Tom and Josh are long-time New York-based journalists who got their start at the Peter Kaplan-era New York Observer. Tom eventually worked on and improved virtually every facet of the operation. Josh cut his teeth there as a political reporter before spending two years covering the New Jersey Statehouse for the New York Times. He then returned to the Observer to oversee the paper’s politics desk and online operation.
		</h2>
		<h2>
		The two ultimately ran the paper until they left in 2009 to start a new publication, Capital New York. The bootstrapped local news outfit attracted independent investment and became an important player covering the politics, infrastructure, cultural institutions and media business in New York City. Capital was acquired in 2013 by POLITICO, and Tom and Josh stayed on to run it.
		</h2>
		<h2>
		That’s when they were joined by Katherine, a journalist who had worked with Chuck Todd at Atlantic Media’s Hotline before coming to POLITICO to launch its Click vertical. Katherine had by then become a multi-disciplinarian who specialized in standing up new efforts and coordinating them across the business, marketing, finance, tech and editorial arms of the company. She was sent to New York to partner with Josh and Tom on expanding Capital, and the three quickly bonded.
		</h2>
		<h2>
		Under this partnership, POLITICO decided to broaden its program in New York from seven to 25 full-time reporters and editors, including a bureau in Albany that would become the largest statehouse operation of any news organization in New York. After that successful start, the three were assigned to replicate the effort in new states, starting with Florida and New Jersey, where POLITICO now has significant journalism outfits devoted to state and local coverage. The three also created satellite “Playbook” operations covering local and state government in California, Illinois and Massachusetts, and in creating a powerful desk of reporters covering the media business and the intersection of media and politics, gaining national recognition for its reporting.
